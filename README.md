This extension is driven by my hatred for any type of ads on the internet, as well as my weak will not to click on them.  

Also, it seems that the two biggest ad blockers are unable to stop the Facebook ads for months now.  

In my opinion all types of website ads are also quite a security risk.
Last time I clicked on a link from a Facebook ad, designed to look like a video clip thumbnail picture (with a triangle and a circle around it) I was redirected to some shady link, that VirusTotal identified as malware and my Facebook profile started to receive friend requests from fake profiles, offering me more maliciousness.
What am I supposed to do now, report the ad to Mark, so he will remove it, cool, but the bad guys will simply make the next one.
And what about my infected PC or compromised account, reporting the ad will not fix that.
Web siting these days is becoming more and more ridiculous.  

Other than this I also wanted to go through the whole process of creating and publishing a Firefox extension.

The combination above led to my first tiny attempt to help the world fight against web ads.

Also, my web dev skills are still quite limited so this is more like a "hobby script", that is not the most performance optimized nor robust enough.
For instance, sometimes the mechanism doesn`t work when you navigate from not root URL to the root URL.

Finally, since the Facebook web environment is quite dynamic, possibly the script will soon be outdated or even better will become obsolete.
Until then, I'll try to support it in my spare time.
